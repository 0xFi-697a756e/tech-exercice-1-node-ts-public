## Prompt

Consider a decentralised exchange protocol where tradable pairs are given by a graph: a currency `A` can be traded for currency `B` if `A` and `B` are linked by and edge. Knowing the list of tradable pairs, develop an algorithm to find the shortest route between a currency `A` and a currency `B`.

## Question 1

Explore the classes and describe their purpose and how they can be used and linked to our use case:

- Vertex (aka Node)
- Graph

## Question 2

Develop the algorithm in the Class ShortestPathAlgo

## Run install and tests

`npm i`
`make test`
